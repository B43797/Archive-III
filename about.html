  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>
    This project publicly confirms the validity of <strong>Goldbach’s Conjecture</strong> up to very large even numbers.
    It is based on a novel method developed by <strong>Bahbouhi Bouchaib</strong>, an independent researcher based in <strong>Nantes, France</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The method used, called the <strong>GPS Method</strong>, is a predictive technique that selects specific values of <code>p</code> such that both <code>p</code> and <code>q = E − p</code> are prime numbers for a given even number <code>E</code>.
    The method has been tested and successfully verified for even numbers up to <strong>10<sup>10000</sup></strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This archive provides selected results only. The work is original and offered as a <strong>public contribution</strong> to mathematics.
    It is not a calculation tool. All results have been precomputed using the GPS strategy and manually verified.
