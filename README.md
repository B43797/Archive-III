# Goldbach Prime Pairs Validation â€“ GPS Method

This repository publicly confirms the validity of **Goldbachâ€™s Conjecture** for extremely large even numbers using a predictive algorithm called the **GPS Method**, developed by **Bahbouhi Bouchaib**.

### âœ… Verified Range

- The conjecture has been **successfully validated up to 10^10000**
- A working example site shows decompositions up to 10^18:

### ðŸ”Ž Contents

- `index.html`: Presentation page with full Goldbach pairs (p, q) such that p + q = 10^X
- Precomputed values for selected large even numbers including:
  - 10^1, 10^2, ..., 10^18, 10^100, 10^10000
- No calculation or user input: this site is an **archive**, not a calculator

### ðŸ“Œ Author and Rights

- Developed by **Bahbouhi Bouchaib**, independent scientist in Nantes, France
- This method and repository are public and free for educational and academic use
